# Doctrine Performance Optimisations

This is the code for the [Doctrine Query Optimisations][1] course at CodeReviewVideos.com

In this video series we will look at a number of different ways to improve and optimise any site that makes use of the awesome Doctrine Project.

We will cover how using Doctrine Query Builder can optimise and improve your querying for faster page loads, and less overhead on your database.

We'll look at how changing your database_host parameter may give your site a sudden kick in the pants.

And we'll touch on indexing, caching our queries, using references, and more besides.
